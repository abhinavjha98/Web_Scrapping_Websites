FST Government Australia 2020,18 November 2020 9:00 am,Virtual Conference,"Today, eGovernment is no mere afterthought; it is an expectation among Australia’s tech-savvy citizenry. This is no accident. It is testament to the states’ progressive adoption of digital infrastructure and e-services across the public sector – an ambition readily embraced by the public. The Federal Government has been at the forefront of this push, becoming a champion – indeed a beacon – for digital transformation efforts across the country. Yet, as technological ambitions are ensnared in the grind of government machinery, efforts to modernise and digitise the Federal bureaucracy are often mired in cost, operational compatibility, and data security considerations. Delivering consistency and continuity within the public sector’s wholesale transformation program will present a major challenge for the Government, particularly as it pursues its long-anticipated digital social services platform, Services Australia."
